# 🎵 Music Store Data Analysis – SQL Project

This project is a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of a digital music store database, modeled on a real-world business scenario. It was developed as part of a **Simplilearn Capstone Project** to demonstrate end-to-end data exploration, business insight generation, and SQL proficiency.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to derive actionable business insights from a music store database using structured query language (SQL). The dataset mimics a typical e-commerce music platform with tables for customers, invoices, tracks, genres, artists, and more.



## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **PostgreSQL**
* SQL (CTEs, joins, subqueries, aggregations, window functions)
* pgAdmin (optional for visualization)
* ER Diagram for schema reference


## 🧩 Database Schema

The database contains 11 tables:

* **Customers**, **Invoices**, **InvoiceLine**
* **Tracks**, **Albums**, **Artists**
* **Genres**, **MediaTypes**
* **Employees**, **Playlists**, **PlaylistTracks**



## 📊 Key Business Questions Answered

### 🔹 Easy Level

* Who is the most senior employee by title?
* Which countries generated the most invoices?
* What are the top 3 invoice totals?
* Which city generated the most revenue?
* Who is the top-spending customer?

### 🔹 Moderate Level

* Who are the listeners of rock music? (with email, sorted A–Z)
* Top 10 rock artists based on track count
* Tracks longer than the average song duration

### 🔹 Advanced Level

* How much did each customer spend on the top artist?
* Customer-wise spending breakdown by artist
* Most popular genre by country
* Top-spending customer per country




## 🚀 How to Run

1. Set up a PostgreSQL instance locally.
2. Import `Music_Store_database.sql` to create the schema and seed data.
3. Use your preferred SQL client (e.g., pgAdmin, DBeaver) to run queries from `Queries.sql`.


## 📈 Insights & Outcomes

This project provided real-world experience in:

* Writing efficient and readable SQL queries
* Data aggregation and customer segmentation
* Using CTEs and window functions for advanced analytics
* Translating raw data into business recommendations
